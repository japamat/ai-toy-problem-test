You also have another integer `target`. Write an algorithm `findTwoIndices(numArray, target)` that will return the indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target. If there are multiple pairs with the same sum, return the first two indexes that complete the sum.\n\nYou can assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.\n\nExample:\n\nInput: numArray = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9\nOutput: [0, 1]\nExplanation: Since numArray[0] + numArray[1] = 2 + 7 = 9\n\nNote:\n\n- The returned answers (both index1 and index2) are not zero-based.\n- You may think of this as solving for indices i and j such that numArray[i] + numArray[j] = target, where index1 must be less than index2.\n\nFunction signature: `def findTwoIndices(numArray: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:`\n\nThe function `findTwoIndices` that takes in:\n\n- A list of integers, `numArray` (-10^5 <= numArray[i] <= 10^5, where 1 <= |numArray| <= 10^5)\n- An integer, `target` (-10^5 <= target <= 10^5)\n\nAnd returns a list of two integers - the indices of the two array elements that add up to the target. If no such pair exists, return an empty list.\n\nThe function should have a Time complexity of O(n), where n is the size of the input array."},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":39,"completion_tokens":355,"total_tokens":394},"system_fingerprint":null}
