The company produces different types of toys daily, and for inventory purposes, each toy is associated with a unique identifier (ID). Before the end of each production day, you are tasked with sorting the toy IDs in ascending order.\n\nTo perform this task, you decided to use the Bubble Sort algorithm. In Bubble Sort, you repetitively compare and swap adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. \n\nYour task is to write a Bubble Sort algorithm that takes a list of integer-based toy IDs as an argument and sorts the list in ascending order.\n\nFunction Signature:\n\n```javascript\nfunction bubbleSort(toyIDs) {\n  // Write your code here\n}\n```\n\nInput:\n\nAn array of integers, toyIDs (1 ≤ toyIDs.length ≤ 1000000; 0 ≤ toyIDs[i] ≤ 1000000)\n\nOutput:\n\nA sorted array of the same integers.\n\nExample:\n\nInput:\nbubbleSort([5, 9, 2, 1, 7])\n\nOutput:\n[1, 2, 5, 7, 9]\n\nNote:\n\nThe above function takes in an array as an input and returns the sorted array using Bubble Sort technique. It takes advantage of the Bubble Sort characteristic of continuously swapping adjacent elements until all the elements are sorted."
