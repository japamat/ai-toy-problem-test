Your task is to implement the Bubble Sort algorithm to sort the array in ascending order.\n\nFunction Signature:\n\nInput: An array 'arr' of n integers (1<=n<=1000), where each element is a distinct number from -1000 to 1000.\n\nOutput: A sorted array 'arr'.\n\nTest Cases:\n\n1) bubbleSort([5, 1, 4, 2, 8]) should return [1, 2, 4, 5, 8].\n2) bubbleSort([64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]) should return [11, 12, 22, 25, 34, 64, 90].\n\nNote:\nIn Bubble sort, on the first pass, the largest element is moved to the end of the array using pair-wise swapping. Second pass, the second largest element is moved to its proper place. This process continues until the array is sorted. \n\nHint:\n1. Iterate over the elements of the array.\n2. For each pair of elements, if the left element is greater than the right, swap them.\n3. Continue steps 1 and 2 until the whole array is sorted (Hint: It's sorted when no more swaps are needed)."
