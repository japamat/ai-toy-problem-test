Keep in mind that the number of students can vary from a minimum of 5 to a maximum of 50.\n\nThe Bubble Sort algorithm works by continuously swapping the adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. \n\nOur task is to implement the Bubble Sort algorithm to sort the list of names in alphabetical order.\n\nFunction Signature: \n```python\ndef bubble_sort_names(names: List[str]) -> List[str]:\n    pass\n```\n\nInput:\n\n`names` list will contain 5 to 50 names(1 <= name.length <= 100), consisting only of English letters.\n\nOutput:\n\nThe function should return a list of names sorted in alphabetical order.\n\nConstraints:\n\n1) All names will be distinct.\n\n2) Names are case sensitive.\n\n3) The length of each name will be at most 100.\n\nExample:\n\n```python\nInput\n[\"Anna\", \"Jon\", \"Eli\", \"Mark\", \"Steve\"]\nOutput\n[\"Anna\", \"Eli\", \"Jon\", \"Mark\", \"Steve\"]\n```\n\n```python\nInput\n[\"Peter\", \"Oliver\", \"Josh\", \"Harry\"]\nOutput\n[\"Harry\", \"Josh\", \"Oliver\", \"Peter\"]\n```\n\nWrite the code for the Bubble Sort algorithm to solve this problem."},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":40,"completion_tokens":284,"total_tokens":324},"system_fingerprint":null}
