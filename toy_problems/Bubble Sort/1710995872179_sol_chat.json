Over multiple iterations, \"larger\" elements bubble up towards the end of the list, and \"smaller\" elements bubble down towards the start of the list. \n\nThis is why it is known as the bubble sort. Note that even though bubble sort is simple, it is not very efficient for large lists. The time complexity for Bubble Sort is O(n^2) as there are n squared steps involved in total to sort all elements.\n\nLet's test our solution with provided examples:\n\n```python\nprint(bubble_sort_names([\"Anna\", \"Jon\", \"Eli\", \"Mark\", \"Steve\"]))  \n# Output: [\"Anna\", \"Eli\", \"Jon\", \"Mark\", \"Steve\"]\n```\n\n```python\nprint(bubble_sort_names([\"Peter\", \"Oliver\", \"Josh\", \"Harry\"]))\n# Output: [\"Harry\", \"Josh\", \"Oliver\", \"Peter\"]\n```"},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":318,"completion_tokens":326,"total_tokens":644},"system_fingerprint":null}
