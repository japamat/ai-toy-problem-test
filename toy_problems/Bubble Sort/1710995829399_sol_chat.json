The time complexity of this solution is O(n) because it only iterates through the input array once. The space complexity is also O(n) for storing elements in the hash table.\n\nHere's how this algorithm works: \n\n1. Iterate over each element in the array.\n2. Check if the difference between the target and the current number already exists in the hash table.\n   - This step effectively checks for the existence of a number that, when added to the current number, equals the target.\n3. If such a number is found, return the indices of both numbers.\n4. If not, add the current number and its index to the hash table.\n\nHere is the solution in Python:\n\n```python\ndef findTwoIndices(numArray, target):\n    num_dict = dict()\n\n    for i, num in enumerate(numArray):\n        if target - num in num_dict:\n            return [num_dict[target - num], i]\n        num_dict[num] = i\n\n    return []\n```\n\nRemember that Python uses 0-based indexing, meaning the first element is at index 0, the second element is at index 1 and so on. Therefore, in the above solution, we return the indices as they are. If you wish to return the indices as 1-based, simply add 1 when returning the indices, like so:\n\n```python\ndef findTwoIndices(numArray, target):\n    num_dict = dict()\n\n    for i, num in enumerate(numArray):\n        if target - num in num_dict:\n            return [num_dict[target - num] + 1, i + 1]\n        num_dict[num] = i + 1\n\n    return []\n```\n\nGood to note that if the problem statement didn't explicitly mention to \"return an empty list\" when no pair exists, we might not need to include the line `return []` as the problem statement assumes that each input would have exactly one solution."},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":389,"completion_tokens":406,"total_tokens":795},"system_fingerprint":null}
