In each pass-through, the largest element will be moved to the correct position in the array, just like a bubble rising to the surface, hence the name \"Bubble Sort\".\n\nThis algorithm has a time complexity O(n^2) since in worst-case and average scenarios, it has to perform n*(n-1) comparisons, where n is the number of items in the array. This would not perform well for large lists, which limits Bubble Sort's usability in real-world applications where time complexity is a critical factor. However, Bubble Sort could still be a good choice when dealing with small lists or for educational purposes, given its simplicity and ease of understanding.\n\nThe above solution is fine for the context given in the problem. But, if we are dealing with large lists which is indicated in the problem's Input constraints (as toyIDs.length can be up to 1000000), then Bubble Sort is not suitable as it would take prohibitively long time to sort. In that case, other efficient sorting algorithms like merge sort, heap sort or quick sort should be considered."
