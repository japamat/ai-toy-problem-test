        "content": "Sure. Here's a toy problem that will help you understand and implement the Bubble Sort algorithm:\n\nProblem Statement:\n\nGiven an unsorted array of integers, write a function `bubbleSort(arr)` that uses the Bubble Sort algorithm to sort the array in ascending order. \n\nThe Bubble Sort algorithm works by repeatedly stepping through the list, comparing each pair of adjacent items and swapping them if they're in the wrong order. This pass through the list is repeated until no more swaps are needed. \n\nInput:\nAn array of unsorted integers. Consider any possible edge cases, such as an empty array, an array of all the same elements, or an array of size 1.\n\nOutput:\nReturn the array sorted in ascending order.\n\nExample:\n\nInput: [9, 7, 5, 11, 12, 2, 14, 3, 10, 6]\n\nOutput: [2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14]\n\nNotes: \n\n- Remember, Bubble Sort is not an efficient sorting algorithm for large data sets. If the given array has a length of n, the time complexity of Bubble Sort is O(n^2) because it has to compare each pair of elements and potentially swap them. \n- Due to its simplicity, Bubble Sort often used as an introduction to sorting algorithms in Computer Science.\n- It is helpful to visualize Bubble Sort as \"bubbling\" the largest unsorted element to its correct place with each iteration. \n\nThe problem is to implement this Bubble Sort algorithm to sort the given array. Happy Coding!"
