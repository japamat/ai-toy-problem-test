## Bubble Sort

### Toy Problem Prompt

Problem: Implement Bubble Sort Algorithm

Description:

Bubble Sort is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.

You are given an array of n integers. Your task is to implement the Bubble Sort algorithm to sort the array in ascending order.

Function Signature:

Input: An array 'arr' of n integers (1<=n<=1000), where each element is a distinct number from -1000 to 1000.

Output: A sorted array 'arr'.

Test Cases:

1) bubbleSort([5, 1, 4, 2, 8]) should return [1, 2, 4, 5, 8].
2) bubbleSort([64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]) should return [11, 12, 22, 25, 34, 64, 90].

Note:
In Bubble sort, on the first pass, the largest element is moved to the end of the array using pair-wise swapping. Second pass, the second largest element is moved to its proper place. This process continues until the array is sorted. 

Hint:
1. Iterate over the elements of the array.
2. For each pair of elements, if the left element is greater than the right, swap them.
3. Continue steps 1 and 2 until the whole array is sorted (Hint: It's sorted when no more swaps are needed).
