### Toy Problem
##### Token Details: `Programming Task: Bubble Sort

Task Description:

In this task, you will implement the bubble sort algorithm to sort an array of integers in ascending order.

Bubble sort is a simple algorithm that works by repeatedly stepping through the list, comparing each pair of adjacent items and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. The 'pass through' the list is repeated until no further swaps are needed, indicating that the list is sorted.

Please create a function called `bubbleSort` that receives an array of integers as a parameter and returns the sorted array.

Function signature:
```python
def bubbleSort(arr: list) -> list:
```

Input:
* The function takes in a list of integers, `arr` (1 <= len(arr) <= 10^4), where each integer, n, (-10^6 <= n <= 10^6).

Output:
* The function should return a list of sorted integers in ascending order.

Constraints:
* Test cases do not include null or empty arrays.
* You can assume there won't be any duplicate numbers in the given array.
* The algorithms runtime should not exceed O(n^2).

Example:

bubbleSort([5, 3, 8, 4, 6])

Should return: [3, 4, 5, 6, 8]

Note: This problem does not have unique solutions and various implementation strategies can be employed as long as it follows the bubble sort algorithm._Details`

Here is a Python solution implementing the Bubble Sort algorithm:

```python
def bubbleSort(arr: list) -> list:
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(0, n - i - 1):
            if arr[j] > arr[j + 1]:
                arr[j], arr[j + 1] = arr[j + 1], arr[j]
    return arr
```

This solution uses two nested loops, one to iterate through the array and the other to compare each element with its next. If the current element is greater than the next one, the elements are swapped.

This continues until the entire list is sorted. 

The reason we decrease the right bound of 'j' in the inner loop each time we finish one full pass through the list (n - i - 1) is because the largest element will be at the end of the list. So, each iteration, the largest unsorted element automatically gets pushed to the end and we no longer need to check the end of the list on each pass. This slightly optimizes the algorithm.

Remember that bubble sort is not an efficient sorting algorithm for large data sets as its worst-case and average time complexities are both O(n^2).

Test the function with given example:

```python
print(bubbleSort([5, 3, 8, 4, 6]))  # Expected output: [3, 4, 5, 6, 8]
```
