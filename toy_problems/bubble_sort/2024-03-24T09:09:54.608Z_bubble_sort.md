Problem: Implement a Bubble Sort Algorithm

Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted. 

Your task is to implement the bubble sort algorithm to sort an array of integers in ascending order. 

Function Signature: 
```python
def bubble_sort(arr: List[int]) -> List[int]:
```

Input: 
The function takes an array of integers, arr (0<=arr[i]<=10^3, 0<=n<=10^6), where n is the number of elements in arr.

Output:
The function should return the array sorted in ascending order.

Examples: 

For example, given an input array of [5, 3, 8, 4, 9, 1, 6, 2, 7], 

bubble_sort([5, 3, 8, 4, 9, 1, 6, 2, 7])

should return [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]


Notes:

Bubble Sort is not a practical sorting algorithm. It has a time complexity of O(n^2), and it does not deal well with a reverse-ordered collection. Bubble sort is used primarily as an educational tool.

### Solution

Here is the Python implementation of the Bubble Sort algorithm:

```python
from typing import List

def bubble_sort(arr: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    n = len(arr)
    
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(0, n-i-1):
            # Swap if the element found is greater
            # than the next element
            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:
                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]
    
    return arr
```

This bubble sort function works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. The outer loop runs over each element in the list, while the inner loop initiates a pass through the list (each pass excludes the last element because it will already be sorted). If a pair of adjacent elements is in the wrong order (i.e., the earlier element is larger than the later one), they are swapped. This process continues until the list is fully sorted.

However, it's important to note that bubble sort isn't efficient for large data sets. It's mainly used for educational purposes to introduce the concept of sorting algorithms due to its simplicity. More efficient sorting algorithms for larger data sets include quick sort, merge sort, heap sort, and so forth.
