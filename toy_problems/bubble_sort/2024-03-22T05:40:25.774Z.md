## Bubble Sort

##### Model: `gpt-4`

### Toy Problem

Problem Title: "Bubble Sort Challenge."

Problem Description:
A local school's computer science club requests your help to teach the students about sorting algorithms. They particularly want to emphasize the Bubble Sort algorithm on an array/list of integers. 

Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted.

Your task is to write a function `bubbleSortArray(arr)` in your favorite programming language, where `arr` is a list of integers given as input, and the output is the sorted version of `arr` using the Bubble Sort algorithm.

Please make sure that the Bubble Sort logic is implemented correctly and no built-in sort functions are used. The students need to understand how to work with nested loops and conditional statements to perform operations on an array.

Function Signature:
In Python:
```python
def bubbleSortArray(arr: List[int]) -> List[int]:
```

In JavaScript:
```javascript
function bubbleSortArray(arr){
}
```

Input:
* An array/list of n integers, where n is between 1 and 1000.

Output:
* A sorted array/list of the same integers.

Examples:

In Python:
```python
bubbleSortArray([3, 2, 5, 1, 7])
# Returns: [1, 2, 3, 5, 7]
```

In JavaScript:
```javascript
bubbleSortArray([7, 2, 6, 4, 5])
// Returns: [2, 4, 5, 6, 7]
```

Constraints:
* Time complexity should be O(n^2) where n is the number of elements in the array/list.

Notes:
Remember, your function should not use any built-in sort functions or modules. The goal is to implement the Bubble Sort algorithm from scratch. Happy coding!

### Solution

Sure, here are implementations of the basic Bubble Sort algorithm in Python and JavaScript:

Python Implementation:

```python
# Implementation in Python
def bubbleSortArray(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n):
        # Traverse through 0 to n-i-1 (Last i elements are already in place)
        for j in range(0, n - i - 1):
            # Traverse the array from 0 to n-i-1
            # Swap if the element found is greater than the next element
            if arr[j] > arr[j+1] :
                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]
    return arr

print(bubbleSortArray([3, 2, 5, 1, 7]))  # Returns: [1, 2, 3, 5, 7]
```

JavaScript Implementation:

```javascript
// Implementation in JavaScript
function bubbleSortArray(arr){
    var n = arr.length;
    for(var i = 0; i < n-1; i++){
        for(var j = 0; j < n-i-1; j++){
            // If the element found is greater than the next element, then swap
            if(arr[j] > arr[j+1]){
                var temp = arr[j];
                arr[j] = arr[j+1];
                arr[j+1] = temp;
            }
        }
    }
    return arr;
}

console.log(bubbleSortArray([7, 2, 6, 4, 5]))  // Returns: [2, 4, 5, 6, 7]
```

Both of these solutions follow the same logic. The outer loop runs n-1 times where n is the number of elements in the array. Inside the outer loop, the inner loop is responsible for comparing elements and swapping them if they are out of order. The comparison happens between a current element and the next element. If the current element is larger than the next one, they get swapped.

This entire process is repeated again and again until the array is sorted. In each iteration, the largest element from the unsorted part is placed at its correct position, thereby "bubbling up" towards the end of the array, which is from where the algorithm gets its name. The time complexity is O(n^2) due to the nested loops.
