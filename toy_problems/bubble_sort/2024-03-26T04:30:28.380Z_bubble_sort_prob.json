        "content": "Problem Name: Bubble Sort with Twist\n\nProblem Description:\n\nBubble Sort is a straightforward sorting algorithm that is easy to understand and implement. While it is not efficient for larger datasets, bubble sort provides a solid foundation for learning more complex sorting algorithms. In this problem, you will implement Bubble Sort with a twist.\n\nWrite a function, `bubbleSortTwist(arr, n)`, that sorts an array of `n` integers using the Bubble Sort algorithm. However, in each iteration of the sort, instead of comparing every pair of elements, your function should only compare every pair of elements where the pair's indices sum is divisible by 3. \n\nIf the pair of elements is out of order and their indices sum is divisible by 3, swap the elements. Repeat this process until the array is sorted.\n\nYour function should return the sorted array.\n\nInput:\n\n- An array of n integers (1 <= n <= 1000), `arr`.\n\nOutput:\n\n- Return a sorted array of n integers.\n\nExamples:\n\nFunction Input: bubbleSortTwist([4, 3, 2, 1], 4)\nFunction Output: [3, 2, 4, 1]\n\nFunction Input: bubbleSortTwist([3, 2, 1, 5, 4], 5)\nFunction Output: [2, 1, 3, 4, 5]\n\nFunction Input: bubbleSortTwist([1, 3, 2, 4, 5, 7, 6], 7)\nFunction Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- You can assume that the input array will always have at least 1 element.\n- You can assume that all elements in the array will be positive integers.\n- It is guaranteed that the array can be sorted under these constraints.\n- The numbers in the array are not necessarily unique.\n\nNote:\n\nMake sure the function sorts the array in place i.e., it should not create and return a new array, rather, it should sort the original array itself."
