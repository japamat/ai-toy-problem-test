The 'pass through' the list is repeated until no further swaps are needed, indicating that the list is sorted.\n\nPlease create a function called `bubbleSort` that receives an array of integers as a parameter and returns the sorted array.\n\nFunction signature:\n```python\ndef bubbleSort(arr: list) -> list:\n```\n\nInput:\n* The function takes in a list of integers, `arr` (1 <= len(arr) <= 10^4), where each integer, n, (-10^6 <= n <= 10^6).\n\nOutput:\n* The function should return a list of sorted integers in ascending order.\n\nConstraints:\n* Test cases do not include null or empty arrays.\n* You can assume there won't be any duplicate numbers in the given array.\n* The algorithms runtime should not exceed O(n^2).\n\nExample:\n\nbubbleSort([5, 3, 8, 4, 6])\n\nShould return: [3, 4, 5, 6, 8]\n\nNote: This problem does not have unique solutions and various implementation strategies can be employed as long as it follows the bubble sort algorithm."
