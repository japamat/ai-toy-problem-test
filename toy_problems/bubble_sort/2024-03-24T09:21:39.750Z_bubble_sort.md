## Bubble Sort

##### Model: `gpt-4`

### Toy Problem

Problem Statement:

Bubble Sort is one of the simplest sorting algorithms. It sorts by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in wrong order. Write a function in your preferred programming language (e.g. Python, Java) that achieves this.

Function Signature:
```java
public static void bubbleSort(int[] arr){...}
```
or 
```python
def bubble_sort(arr):...
```

Input:
The input will be a random unsorted array of integers. Your program should then implement the bubble sort algorithm to sort these integers into ascending order.

Example

If you are writing in Python, here's an example input and output:

Input:
```python
arr = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]
bubble_sort(arr)
```
Output: `[11, 2, 22, 25, 34, 64, 90]`

If you are writing in Java, here's an example input and output:

Input:
```java
int arr[] = {64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90}
bubbleSort(arr)
```
Output: `[11, 2, 22, 25, 34, 64, 90]`

**Note:**
While bubble sort is simple, it is not efficient for large data sets. It has an O(n^2) time complexity, where n is the number of items being sorted.

Bonus: Write a function that can sort the array in both ascending and descending order based on a parameter.

### Solution

I will provide a solution with python:

```python
def bubble_sort(arr, order='asc'):
    n = len(arr)

    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(0, n - i - 1):
            if arr[j] > arr[j + 1]:
                arr[j], arr[j + 1] = arr[j + 1], arr[j]

    if order == 'desc':
        arr.reverse()

    return arr
```
You can modify this code to sort the array in both ascending and descending order based on a parameter.

**Example:**

```python
arr = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]
print(bubble_sort(arr, order='asc'))  # Output: [11, 12, 22, 25, 34, 64, 90]
print(bubble_sort(arr, order='desc'))  # Output: [90, 64, 34, 25, 22, 12, 11]
```

For Java:

```java
public static void bubbleSort(int arr[], String order){
    int n = arr.length;
    for(int i = 0; i < n-1; i++){
        for (int j = 0; j < n-i-1; j++){
            if (arr[j] > arr[j+1])
            {
                int temp = arr[j];
                arr[j] = arr[j+1];
                arr[j+1] = temp;
            }
        }
    }

    if(order.equals("desc")){
        for(int i=0; i<n/2; i++){
            int temp = arr[i];
            arr[i] = arr[n-i-1];
            arr[n-i-1] = temp;
        }
    }
}
```

**Example:**

```java
int arr[] = {64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90}
bubbleSort(arr, "asc");  // Output: [11, 12, 22, 25, 34, 64, 90]
bubbleSort(arr, "desc");  // Output: [90, 64, 34, 25, 22, 12, 11]
```
