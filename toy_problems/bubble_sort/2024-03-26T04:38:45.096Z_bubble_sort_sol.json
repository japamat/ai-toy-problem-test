        "content": "Here is a Python solution implementing the Bubble Sort algorithm:\n\n```python\ndef bubbleSort(arr: list) -> list:\n    n = len(arr)\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(0, n - i - 1):\n            if arr[j] > arr[j + 1]:\n                arr[j], arr[j + 1] = arr[j + 1], arr[j]\n    return arr\n```\n\nThis solution uses two nested loops, one to iterate through the array and the other to compare each element with its next. If the current element is greater than the next one, the elements are swapped.\n\nThis continues until the entire list is sorted. \n\nThe reason we decrease the right bound of 'j' in the inner loop each time we finish one full pass through the list (n - i - 1) is because the largest element will be at the end of the list. So, each iteration, the largest unsorted element automatically gets pushed to the end and we no longer need to check the end of the list on each pass. This slightly optimizes the algorithm.\n\nRemember that bubble sort is not an efficient sorting algorithm for large data sets as its worst-case and average time complexities are both O(n^2).\n\nTest the function with given example:\n\n```python\nprint(bubbleSort([5, 3, 8, 4, 6]))  # Expected output: [3, 4, 5, 6, 8]\n```"
