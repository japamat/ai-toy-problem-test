        "content": "Here is the implementation of the Bubble Sort with Twist problem using Python:\n\n```python\ndef bubbleSortTwist(arr, n):\n    # Outer loop for number of passes\n    for i in range(n):\n        # Inner loop for pairwise comparison and swapping\n        for j in range(n - 1):\n            # Only compare pairs of elements where the pair's indices sum is divisible by 3\n            if (i + j) % 3 == 0:\n                if arr[j] > arr[j + 1]:\n                    # Swapping elements if they are out of order\n                    arr[j], arr[j + 1] = arr[j + 1], arr[j]\n    return arr\n```\n\nThis function works by making n passes over the array. In each pass, it compares pairs of elements where the pair's indices sum is divisible by 3. If a pair of elements is out of order, it swaps them. This process is repeated until the array is sorted.\n\nThis implementation modifies the array in place, meaning it does not create and return a new array, but rather sorts the original array itself. \n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other problems or questions."
