Problem Title: Merge Sort Array

Problem Description:

You are given a list of `N` integer numbers. Your task is to create a function `mergeSort(arr)` that sorts the provided list in ascending order using the Merge Sort algorithm and returns the sorted list. Assume all elements in the list are distinct.

Function Signature: 
```python
def mergeSort(arr: List[int]) -> List[int]:
```

Input:
- A list of `N` integers, where `1 <= N <= 10^5`. Each integer `arr[i]` is such that `-10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9`.

Output:
- The list sorted in ascending order.

Example:

```python
Input: [5, 3, 7, 1, 2, 6, 4]
Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]

Input: [26, 13, 40, -6, 75, 19]
Output: [-6, 13, 19, 26, 40, 75]
```

Note:

In the merge sort algorithm, you first divide the list into two half lists. Each half is individually sorted and then merged together to get a completely sorted list.

The process of dividing the list into halves is straightforward. But how do you merge two sorted lists together?

The basic idea is the following:

1. You start at the beginning of each list and compare the current elements.

2. You insert the smaller of the two into the final list and move its list's current element to the next one.

3. When one list is empty, you add all remaining elements from the other list to the final list.

Remember that the key characteristic of merge sort is its "divide and conquer" approach to sorting data.

Here is a Python implementation of the Merge Sort algorithm:

```python
from typing import List

def merge(arr1: List[int], arr2: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    # Function to merge two sorted lists
    sorted_arr = []
    i = j = 0
    while i < len(arr1) and j < len(arr2):
        if arr1[i] < arr2[j]:
            sorted_arr.append(arr1[i])
            i += 1
        else:
            sorted_arr.append(arr2[j])
            j += 1
    while i < len(arr1):
        sorted_arr.append(arr1[i])
        i += 1
    while j < len(arr2):
        sorted_arr.append(arr2[j])
        j += 1
    return sorted_arr

def mergeSort(arr: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    # Base case: If list has 1 or 0 element, it is already sorted
    if len(arr) <= 1:
        return arr
    mid = len(arr) // 2
    # Divide 
    left = mergeSort(arr[:mid])
    right = mergeSort(arr[mid:])
    # Conquer: Merge two sorted halves
    return merge(left, right)
```
In the `mergeSort` function, we first check if the length of `arr` is less than or equal to 1. If it is, we simply return `arr` as it is already sorted. Otherwise, we find the middle index of `arr` and divide `arr` into two halves. We recursively sort the left and right halves, and then merge them using the `merge` function to produce the final sorted list.

The `merge` function takes in two sorted lists `arr1` and `arr2`, and merges them into a single sorted list. It maintains two pointers `i` and `j`, that point to the current elements being considered in `arr1` and `arr2` respectively. At each step, it appends the smaller of these two elements to the final sorted list, and increments the pointer for the list from which this smaller element was taken. When one of the lists is exhausted, it appends all remaining elements from the other list to the final list.

The time complexity of merge sort is O(N log N) where N is the number of elements in the list, as we divide the problem into two halves at each level and repeat this process log N levels deep, and merging at each level takes O(N) time. The space complexity is also O(N), due to the extra space needed for the `merge` function.
