Your task is to create a function `mergeSort(arr)` that sorts the provided list in ascending order using the Merge Sort algorithm and returns the sorted list. Assume all elements in the list are distinct.\n\nFunction Signature: \n```python\ndef mergeSort(arr: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n```\n\nInput:\n- A list of `N` integers, where `1 <= N <= 10^5`. Each integer `arr[i]` is such that `-10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9`.\n\nOutput:\n- The list sorted in ascending order.\n\nExample:\n\n```python\nInput: [5, 3, 7, 1, 2, 6, 4]\nOutput: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]\n\nInput: [26, 13, 40, -6, 75, 19]\nOutput: [-6, 13, 19, 26, 40, 75]\n```\n\nNote:\n\nIn the merge sort algorithm, you first divide the list into two half lists. Each half is individually sorted and then merged together to get a completely sorted list.\n\nThe process of dividing the list into halves is straightforward. But how do you merge two sorted lists together?\n\nThe basic idea is the following:\n\n1. You start at the beginning of each list and compare the current elements.\n\n2. You insert the smaller of the two into the final list and move its list's current element to the next one.\n\n3. When one list is empty, you add all remaining elements from the other list to the final list.\n\nRemember that the key characteristic of merge sort is its \"divide and conquer\" approach to sorting data."
