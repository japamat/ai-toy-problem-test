Problem Title: Implement Insertion Sort Algorithm 

Problem Description:

Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by building one sorted sublist at a time. It is much less efficient compared to other sorting algorithms like quicksort or mergesort, but it has its uses especially when dealing with a small list.

For this task, you need to implement an insertion sort algorithm.

Please write a function `insertionSort(arr)` where `arr` is an array of integers. The function should return a new array which is a sorted version of `arr` in ascending order. 

Constraints:
* The array `arr` will have at least 1 and at most 10^3 elements.
* Each element in `arr` is an integer in the range of -10^3 to 10^3.

Input: 

An array of integers.

Output:

A sorted array of integers.

Function signature: 

`function insertionSort(arr: number[]): number[]`

Examples:

Input: 

insertionSort([4, 3, 2, 10, 12, 1, 5, 6])

Output: 

[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12]

Note:
- In this example, the function receives an array with elements [4, 3, 2, 10, 12, 1, 5, 6]. When using the insertion sort algorithm the array will be sorted to [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12].
  
Input: 

insertionSort([10, -1, 2, 5, 0, 6, -9, -3])

Output: 

[-9, -3, -1, 0, 2, 5, 6, 10]

Note:
- In this example, the function receives an array with elements [10, -1, 2, 5, 0, 6, -9, -3]. When using the insertion sort algorithm the array will be sorted to [-9, -3, -1, 0, 2, 5, 6, 10].

### Solution

Here's a JavaScript implementation of the insertion sort algorithm:

```javascript
function insertionSort(arr) {
    let n = arr.length;
    for (let i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        let key = arr[i];
        let j = i - 1;
        while (j >= 0 && arr[j] > key) {
            arr[j + 1] = arr[j];
            j = j - 1;
        }
        arr[j + 1] = key;
    }
    return arr;
}

```

The function `insertionSort` works as follows:

1. The outer loop runs `n` times where `n` is the length of the input array `arr`. The outer loop starts from the second element (at index 1) and goes to the end of the array.
2. In each iteration of the outer loop, the current element `arr[i]` is saved in the variable `key`. This is the element that we need to insert at the correct position in the sorted sublist of the array.
3. The inner `while` loop shifts elements of the sorted sublist that are greater than the key to one position ahead.
4. After the `while` loop finishes, we find the correct position for the `key` and assign it to `arr[j + 1]`, where `j` is now the index of the last element that's smaller than the key.

This function manipulates the input array in-place to sort it, and finally, it returns the sorted array.

For example, if you call `insertionSort([4, 3, 2, 10, 12, 1, 5, 6])`, the function will sort the array in-place and return `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12]`.

Similarly, if you call `insertionSort([10, -1, 2, 5, 0, 6, -9, -3])`, the function will sort the array in-place and return `[-9, -3, -1, 0, 2, 5, 6, 10]`.
