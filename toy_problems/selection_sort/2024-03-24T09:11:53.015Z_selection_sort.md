Problem Title: Selection Sort Implementation

Problem Statement:
You are given an unordered list of integers as input. Your task is to write a function named "selectionSort" that implements the Selection Sort algorithm. 

The Selection Sort algorithm sorts a list by finding the minimum element from the unsorted part of the list and swapping it with the leftmost unsorted element, moving the boundary between the sorted part and the unsorted part one element to the right.

Function Signature: 
```python
def selectionSort(lst: List[int]) -> List[int]:
```

Input:

* A list 'lst' of n integers (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000).

Output:

* A list of 'n' integers sorted in ascending order. 

Constraints: 
* Numbers in the list can be any integer between -1000 and 1000.

Example:

```python
assert selectionSort([29, 10, 14, 37, 14]) == [10, 14, 14, 29, 37]
assert selectionSort([5, 2, 9, 1, 5, 6]) == [1, 2, 5, 5, 6, 9]
```

Note:
In the first example, the function gets [29, 10, 14, 37, 14] as an input, and returns [10, 14, 14, 29, 37], which is the sorted form of the input list.

In the second case, the function gets [5, 2, 9, 1, 5, 6] as an input, and should return [1, 2, 5, 5, 6, 9], which is the sorted form of the input list.


Note:
Be careful of edge cases, such as empty lists or lists with only one element. In those cases, the function should return the input list as is, considering it already sorted. Similarly, if the list contains all the same elements, return the list as it is since it's also considered already sorted.

### Solution

```python
from typing import List

def selectionSort(lst: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    n = len(lst)
    for i in range(n):
        # Find the minimum element in remaining unsorted array
        minIndex = i
        for j in range(i+1, n):
            if lst[j] < lst[minIndex]:
                minIndex = j
        # Swap the found minimum element with the first element of the unsorted part       
        lst[i], lst[minIndex] = lst[minIndex], lst[i]
    return lst
```
