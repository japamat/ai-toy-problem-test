## Selection Sort

##### Model: `gpt-4`

### Toy Problem

Title: Selection Sort Problem 

Problem:

You are given an array of n integers, where n >= 2. Your task is to implement the selection sort algorithm to sort the array in ascending order.

Function signature:
```python
def selectionSort(arr: List[int]) -> List[int]:
```

In this function: 
- arr: An array of n integers (0 <= arr[i] <= 10^4)

The function must return the sorted array in ascending order.

Constraints:
- Do not use any built-in sort functions.
- The selection sort algorithm operates by finding the smallest (or largest, depending on sorting order) element in the array and placing it at the start. This process is repeated for the remaining sublist, moving down along the list.
- The function must sort the array using the selection sort algorithm.
- Do not use any extra space (Do not use any data structure for your program).

Example:

1.
Input:
```python
selectionSort([7, 5, 2, 8, 6])
```
Output:
```python
[2, 5, 6, 7, 8]
```
In this example, the function sorts the array using the selection sort algorithm.

2.
Input:
```python
selectionSort([10, 50, 20, 40, 30])
```
Output:
```python
[10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
```
In this example, the function sorts the array using the selection sort algorithm.

### Solution

Here's the Python solution using Selection Sort algorithm without using any additional space:

Selection Sort is a simple sorting algorithm with quadratic time complexity. This sorting algorithm is an in-place comparison-based algorithm where the list is divided into two parts, the sorted part at the left end and the unsorted part at the right end.

Initially, the sorted part is empty and the unsorted part is the entire list. The smallest element is selected from the unsorted array and swapped with the leftmost element & that element becomes a part of the sorted array. This process continues moving unsorted array boundary by one element to the right.

Let's implement this:

```python
from typing import List

def selectionSort(arr: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    # Traverse through all array elements
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        # Find the index of the smallest element in remaining unsorted array
        min_idx = i
        for j in range(i+1, len(arr)):
            if arr[j] < arr[min_idx]:
                min_idx = j
                
        # Swap the found minimum element with the first element of 'unsorted' part      
        arr[i], arr[min_idx] = arr[min_idx], arr[i]
    
    return arr
```

The time complexity for this algorithm is O(n^2) as there are two nested loops. This makes it inefficient on large lists, and generally it performs worse than the similar insertion sort. 

These are acceptable for smaller lists or as a building block of more advanced algorithms, but for larger or real-world data, other sorting algorithms like Quick Sort, Merge Sort, or Heap Sort are much more efficient.
