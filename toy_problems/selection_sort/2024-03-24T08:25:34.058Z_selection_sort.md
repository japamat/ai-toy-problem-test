Problem:
"Implement the Selection Sort"

In computer science, selection sort is a sorting algorithm for ordering an array of items. The algorithm divides the input array into two parts: a sorted subarray of items which is built up from left to right at the front (left) of the array and a subarray of the remaining unsorted items placed in the rest of the array.

You are tasked to implement the selection sort algorithm that sorts an array of integers in ascending order.

Your function should take in an unsorted array of integer values and return a new array containing the same integer values sorted in ascending order using the selection sort algorithm.

Function Signature: 

``` 
    def selection_sort(arr: List[int]) -> List[int]:
```
    
Input:
- arr (1 <= len(arr) <= 10^5): An array of integers (-10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9, where 0 <= i < len(arr)).

Output:
- Return a sorted array.

Example:

The function `selection_sort([5, 2, 8, 6, 1, 3, 9])` will return `[1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9]`

Note:

In selection sort algorithm, we search for the smallest element in each iteration and place it in its correct position. We maintain two subarrays in a given array:

- The subarray which is already sorted.
- Remaining subarray which is unsorted.

In every iteration of the selection sort algorithm, the minimum element from the unsorted subarray is picked and moved to the sorted subarray.

Please implement this algorithm without using Python's built-in sort functions.

### Solution

Here is a Python implementation of the selection sort algorithm as per your described specifications:

```python
def selection_sort(arr):
    # length of the array
    n = len(arr)

    # iterate over all the elements of the array
    for i in range(n):
        # Find the minimum element in the remaining unsorted array
        min_idx = i
        for j in range(i+1, n):
            if arr[j] < arr[min_idx]:
                min_idx = j

        # Swap the found minimum element with the first element of the unsorted array
        arr[i], arr[min_idx] = arr[min_idx], arr[i]
        
    return arr
```

This function loops through each element in the array, then in the second nested loop it finds the smallest element in the remaining unsorted part of the array. Once the smallest element is found, it is swapped with the first unsorted element. This continues until the entire array is sorted.

For example, with the input `[5, 2, 8, 6, 1, 3, 9]`, the function will perform following operations:

1. `[1, 2, 8, 6, 5, 3, 9]` (smallest element is 1)
2. `[1, 2, 8, 6, 5, 3, 9]` (smallest remaining element is 2)
3. `[1, 2, 3, 6, 5, 8, 9]` (smallest remaining element is 3)
4. `[1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9]` (smallest remaining element is 5)
5. `[1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9]` (smallest remaining element is 6)
6. `[1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9]` (smallest remaining element is 8)
7. `[1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9]` (smallest remaining element is 9)

After these operations, we are left with a sorted array.

Please note that selection sort has a time complexity of O(n^2), which makes it inefficient on large lists compared to other algorithms such as quicksort, mergesort, or heapsort. It is typically used for educational purposes and for small data sets.
